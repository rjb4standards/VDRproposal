Expedition, previously known as the Migration Tool, is a free tool that facilitates migration to the Palo Alto Networks NGFW platform from other firewall vendors and provides a temporary workspace for optimizing Palo Alto Networks security policies. Expedition is designed to only be used temporarily for migration purposes, not to be run in production. You do not need it to operate any Palo Alto Networks products or services. Expedition reached its End of Life (EoL) date on December 31, 2024. Please use the suggested alternatives listed in the Expedition End of Life Announcement (https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/expedition-articles/important-update-end-of-life-announcement-for-palo-alto-networks/ta-p/589642).

These issues do not affect the firewalls, Panorama, Prisma Access, or Cloud NGFW.","The fixes for all listed issues are available in Expedition 1.2.96, and all later Expedition versions.
The cleartext file affected by CVE-2024-9466 will be removed automatically during the upgrade.
All Expedition usernames, passwords, and API keys should be rotated after upgrading to the fixed version of Expedition.
All firewall usernames, passwords, and API keys processed by Expedition should be rotated after updating.","Ensure networks access to Expedition is restricted to authorized users, hosts, or networks.
If Expedition is not in active use, ensure that Expedition software is shut down.
For CVE-2024-9465, you can check for an indicator of compromise with the following command on an Expedition system (replace ""root"" with your username if you are using a different username):
    mysql -uroot -p -D pandb -e ""SELECT * FROM cronjobs;""
If you see any records returned, this indicates a potential compromise. Please note that if no records are returned, the system may still be compromised. This is only intended to indicate a potential compromise, rather than confirm a system has not been compromised.
There are no practical indicators of compromise for the remainder of the CVEs in this advisory.",https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/PAN-SA-2024-0010
